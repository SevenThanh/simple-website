              <li>🤔 At 13, my mom asked me if I wanted to come to America with her. Guess what I said?</li>
              <li>🏋 Every day around 4 pm, you'll find me either at the gym or on a basketball court (not 6ft and not even good T^T)</li>
              <li>🎶 Can't live without music though; I don't have a specific type; if it's good, it's good</li>
              <li>😗 Very friendly and chill person, so don't hesitate to reach out. I’m always down for whatever</li>
              <li>🌍 Love traveling to different places and experiencing new things. Life is too short; keep an open mind so you don't waste it</li>
              <li>💙 Whoever's reading this, remember to always be kind and love yourself</li>
