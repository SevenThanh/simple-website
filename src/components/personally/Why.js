                <h3>i) Tuition & Housing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>After I went to college, my mom moved to Texas right away for lower rent and taxes. Because of this, my FAFSA tax information changed from NJ to TX, meaning I was no longer considered an NJ resident and lost eligibility for state aid and scholarships. As a result, I could no longer afford Stevens.</li>
                    <li>This was the main reason I had to overwork during the school year to pay for my student loans. The stress piled up, and what happened nextâ€¦ well, you all already know.</li>
                    <li>Before committing to Stevens, I explained my financial situation to the school. I was told by an Associate Director of Financial Aid that Stevens students typically have no trouble receiving aid and that the school would absolutely help me.</li>
                    <li>There were multiple errors in my tuition billing that I caught just in time. If I hadn't, I would have overpaid for no reason.</li>
                    <li>When I asked for the total amount I needed to borrow to cover this year's tuition, they gave me the wrong number <strong>twice</strong>. This led to me taking out multiple loans unnecessarily.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>ii) Other Things</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I want to transfer to a bigger school for more research opportunities, clubs, and activities.</li>
                    <li>I'm interested in learning more about <strong>Psychology & Philosophy</strong>, but it's difficult to enroll in the humanities classes I want here.</li>
                    <li>Most of the classes I want to take don't even have professors teaching them.</li>
                </ul>
