        <p>
          I created this simple website for you to get to know me both{' '}

          <Link to="/personally">personally</Link> (preferably both because I think I'm pretty awesome sauceðŸ˜Š)

        <p>
        Iâ€™d like to sincerely thank Dr. Jason Rabinovitch, Dr. Virginia Con, and Dr. Philippe Meunier for agreeing to write me a letter of recommendation. 
        </p>
        <p>
        To you, it may just be a letter, but to me, itâ€™s a chance to build a brighter futureâ€”one where I can help my grandma with her cancer treatment, 
        support my mom with her rent, assist my relatives in Vietnam with their farming work, and give kids in underprivileged areas access to the education they deserve.
